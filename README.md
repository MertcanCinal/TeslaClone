 I did this project in terms of reinforcing my HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript skills.
In my project, I especially made "responsive" design and editing, and also used basic JavaScript elements such as drop-down menu, button functionality.
Each section is in the "section" tag; I defined it with classes like "sectionOne", "sectionTwo".
